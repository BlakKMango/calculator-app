# calculator-app
Final project for The Odin Project - Foundations course. Task: Build an on screen calculator using html, css, and javascript.



# PSEUDO & PLANNING

## Calculator design
We need the following:
- Main container that will represent the calculator case.
    - class = calc
- The buttons - all the same size
    - class = calc-buttons
- The screen - to display input & result
    - calc-screen

## Positioning and responsiveness
It should maintain it's size until it can no longer fit on the screen. 
If it shrinks, it should shrink uniformly. I do not want the buttons and display to move.


# How the calculator works
1. When the user presses a number it appears on the screen.
2. When the user presses an operator:
    - The screen clears for another number to be added
    - The choice of operator triggers the correct calculation
3. The user enters another number
    - Repeat as above
4. When the equals sign is pressed, the result is shown on the screen
